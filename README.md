## Django application with User and ActivityPeriod models with an API to serve that data in the json format.

### The biggest reason to use Django REST Framework is because it makes serialization so effortless!


#### Django-seed uses the faker library to generate test data for your Django models. This has been "hard-forked" from django_faker in order to support newer versions of Python and Django

#### Django-seed allows you to write code to generate models, and seed your database with one simple manage.py command!

## Getting Started
1. Set up Django
2. Create a model in the database that the Django ORM will manage
3. Set up the Django REST Framework
4. Serialize the model from step 2
5. Create the URI endpoints to view the serialized data
